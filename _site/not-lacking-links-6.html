<p>While we're at it, Jeb's '4% GDP growth' is crazy talk. My problem with his proposal is that he will never be willing to enact the necessary reforms that would spur the growth necessary to see such economic progress. At best, he'll throw a few minor reforms and fall flat on his face when 4% GDP growth never shows. It is not that I do not believe high economic growth is possible, but that I believe Jeb would never be willing to do the things necessary to spur this growth.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/upshot/economists-advise-us-not-to-hold-our-breath-on-jeb-bushs-growth-target.html" target="_blank">A bunch of economists agree</a>.</p>

<p>Long over due for a market 'correction,' China's major stock indexes experience a crashed over the weekend. The source of the correction comes from the overvaluation of several tech stocks, some of which have experienced an over 100x increase in value. This is the biggest correction the Chinese market has seen since 2008.</p>

<p>If this precedence holds for larger rulings (as in, for all Uber drivers in Cali), then Uber's cost of business will sky rocket will make its relations with drivers much more rigid. Employee classification entails that Uber provides all the various benefits of employment, such as medical insurance and mandatory time off, despite the very 'consensual' relation Uber has with drivers (they can work as much as they want, when they want, etc).</p>
