> The informed public's impressions of the crisis are based in part on the journalists' and scholars' hasty pronouncements. These impressions have now hardened into convictions. Political movements of the right and the left are already acting upon dogmas about the crisis that have little or no basis in fact, and policy changes have been made on the basis of these dogmas. Moreover, mass attitudes that have been formed in the crucible of an economic catastrophe cannot be expected to change even if, in the future, careful scholars overturn the assumptions that were the basis for these attitudes.
