Over a year ago, I read Jeffrey Friedman and Wladimir Kraus' *Engineering the Financial Crisis: Systemic Risk and the Failure of Regulation* which was unfortunate because that is also roughly when I began to slack on blogging. I've come back to correct this mistake, however, as Friedman and Kraus' book is one that deserves to be discussed and reviewed. Within this slim book, a mere 156 pages when excluding references, is a tour de force in analysis and theory with the authors providing a concise and powerful indictment of mainstream theories of the crisis, construct a theory of their own, and provide a fierce criticism (or warning?) of the state of modern economics when faced with an increasingly complex economy.

# Why I Chose It

To quote the first sentence of the introduction, "this is not the ordinary book about the financial crisis." Jeffrey Friedman is the editor and Kraus an associate editor of *Critical Review*, an academic journal that is known for publishing exceptional articles in the social sciences. Friedman, a political theorist, and Kraus, an economist, make for a good combination in creating a book that, in their own words, "make it interesting to historians, philosophers, legal theorists, political scientists, and sociologists as well as to economists and educated laypeople." In other words, Friedman and Kraus come from a background that isn't afraid to synthesize theory from different fields of thought and, consequentially, tend to come to conclusions that vary greatly from that of the mainstream.

I want to make it clear, however, that I am not fetishizing heterodox theory for the sake of heterodoxy. Contrary, the literature base for the financial crisis is filled with academics that are incredibly **sure** of their diagnosis of the crisis whereas Friedman and Kraus show that not only are these theories problematic but the entire picture itself is much more complicated than what most want to believe. Altogether, this is why I chose *Engineering the Financial Crisis* as a resource for my research on the crisis of 2007.

# Summary

Friedman and Kraus' book is split into four sections, paraphrased as the following:

1. Explaining the problems behind the general theories of too big to fail, corporate compensation, deregulation, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and "market irrationality" as causes of the financial crisis.
2. Explaining the regulations behind capital minimums for banks, the regulatory monopoly of credit rating agencies, and market-to-market accounting.
3. How capital minimums, credit rating regulations, and market-to-market accounting created a perfect storm of complexity that hid risk from banks and regulators alike.
4. The major problems facing a regulatory regime faced with complex economic systems and the consequences of legislating solutions to problems that are inherently heterodox and uncertain in nature.

## Problems with Mainstream Theories of the Financial Crisis and Modern Policy Making

Friedman and Kraus spare no one when they cover the problems with most of the contemporary theories for the financial crisis. In the first section of this book, they tackle both the theoretical and empirical problems behind each theory, showing consistently that behaviors expected by economic and political theory were not exhibited by the agents involved. Friedman and Kraus also show the lack of partisanship in their writing, as they attack pet theories of both the left and right, discrediting theories blaming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (a favorite of conservatives) and market irrationality/deregulation (a favorite of liberals) alike.

What is especially enjoyable is the eloquence and clarity that Friedman and Kraus use to dispatch these theories. A rough generalization of their approach is taking a given theory and explain its arguments, apply said arguments to their logical conclusion(s), and then show how empirically this is not exhibited by the data on hand. A good example of this is showing how profit maximization, as an extension of the moral hazard/corporate compensation theories, was not a behavior exhibited by major investment banks when looking at their total holdings of investment securities. Under the theory of profit maximization of hyper logical (and morally indifferent) economic agents, we would assume banks would invest minimally (to the extent they could get away with) in AAA rated securities, like AAA Private-Label Mortgage Backed Securities (PLMBS), since they give the least return on investment; conversely,  we would assume that these profit maximizing agents, indifferent to the long term risk they engender in return for short term profit, would maximize their holdings in riskier, low credit rating assets to maximize their economic profit. However, as Friedman and Kraus make clear, this behavior was not exhibited empirically as most banks nearly maximized their investment in AAA assets and thus shielded themselves from unnecessary risk.

Besides disproving empirically incorrect theories, they call out bad theorizing when they see it, such as that espoused by Stiglitz and Shiller with their theories of deregulation and irrational exuberance, respectively. It is in passages like these that you realize the full benefit of a book co-authored by a political theorist and economist. To take an example, Friedman points out the humorous circle of logic with Stiglitz's policy recommendation for preventing problems like the financial crisis: just put in charge the regulators who would of seen the problem before it became a problem! Of course! In the passage, Friedman points out the humor and fault in Stiglitz's theory, stating in Swiftian jest to simply "elect legislators and hire regulators who would do whatever Stiglitz would do, or **_would have done in retrospect_**" to prevent future crises.

In the process of deconstructing bad theory, Friedman and Kraus also show problems facing public officials and democratic systems when deciding public policy. In particular, the authors show how democratic governments, in response to problems, conflate prescriptive analysis (what should be done about the problem) with descriptive analysis (what caused the problem). The former works fine when discusses politics generally, but it is the latter that is necessary if a democracy wants to create effective public policy. Unfortunately, individuals like economists and government regulators are forced into positions of policy recommendation and thus must attempt to predict the future of policy implementation. This incentivizes the use of prescriptive analysis and institutionalizes hindsight bias like that exhibited by Stiglitz. This results in a shallow and detrimental form of policy creation, where "social complexity grows, [while] our understanding of society shrinks, because our interest in the empirics of social and economic problems becomes secondary to thinking up policy solutions for them."
