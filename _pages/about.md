My name is Elias Julian Marko Garcia, and I'm a student interested in economics, computer science, and maths. Between 2012-2015 I blogged a lot at [LackingMaterial][Lackingmaterial] but stopped due to that peculiar distraction known as 'life'. Around 2016, I decided I wanted to return to writing and rebuilt this blog on my server.

Ageof.Info is titled eponymously for what will probably be the most disruptive and chaotic period in human history: [the Age of Information][AgeofInformation]. 

*Will you be amongst the heterodoxy or will you comply?*

## Errata 

This blog was created using a raspberry pi, [nginx][nginx], and [Jekyll][jekyll].

All posts dating from 2015 and earlier were migrated over from my old blog, [Lacking Material][LackingMaterial]. If you see a formatting error I failed to fix, I would appreciate the pointer!
