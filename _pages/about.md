My name is Elias Julian Marko Garcia, and I'm a student of economics, computer science, and maths at Truman State University. Between 2012-2015 I blogged a lot at [LackingMaterial.com][Lackingmaterial] but stopped due to college and applying for internships. In October (2016), I decided to bring back my blog, along with building the server that hosts it, and this is the end result. 

Ageof.Info is a blog titled eponymously for what I find myself most fascinated with: [the Age of Information][AgeofInformation]. In particular, you will find ramblings on contemporary macroeconomics, new institutional theory, and how technology has its role in all of this.


## For those interested

This blog is hosted on a raspbery pi B+ using Nginx as the server platform. Here's a guide to get [started][started] if you'd like to do the same! I'll post about how I did this myself soon enough with some updates and more clarity, but that's a good start nonetheless.

As for the blog itself, it was created using [Jekyll][jekyll], a really easy to use static content generator. I highly recommend it.


## Errata 

All posts dating from 2015 and earlier were migrated over from my old blog, [Lacking Material][LackingMaterial]. As a result, the formatting for those posts is not exactly *right*  and you may even see some code here or there as a result of the migration. **Please email me** if you see something so I can add it to the list of edits to make when I have time.
