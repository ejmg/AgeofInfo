Here's a collection of links to various opportunities within either tech or economics. Please feel free to email me about other opportunities available and I'll post it up here. The only requirements are that it is free (or better, paid) and is targeted towards students.

As with all applications, it is always best to apply *now* rather than *later.* In particular, you will notice how many Hackathons have no "due date" for application so apply while you can!
