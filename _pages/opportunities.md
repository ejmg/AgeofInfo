Collection of links to various opportunities within either tech or economics, particularly those
targeted at underrepresented groups. I post and edit links when I can, so no promises that the
opportunities posted below are still relevant. 

It's already stupid how hard it can be to find relatively open programs like those below, so I hope
posting these will help someone.
