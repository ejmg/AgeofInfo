## Thanks for Visiting

My name is Elias Garcia, and I'm a student of economics, computer science, and maths at Truman State University. I've decided to make a personal website for myself, along with the actual server and the various infrastructure that runs underneath the hood, so this site is currently under works in case you can't tell. Besides tinkering with computers, my passion is studying institutions, complex adaptive systems, and economic applications of computer science.

All posts dating from 2015 and earlier were migrated over from my old blog, [Lacking Material][LackingMaterial]. As a result, the formatting for those posts is not exactly *right*  and you may even see some code here or there as a result of the migration. **Please email me** if you see something so I can add it to the list of edits to make when I have time.

## For those interested

This blog is hosted on a raspbery pi B+ using Nginx as the server platform. Here's a guide to get [started][started] if you'd like to do the same! I'll post about how I did this myself soon enough with some updates and more clarity, but that's a good start nonetheless.

As for the blog itself, it was created using [Jekyll][jekyll], a really easy to use static content generator. I highly recommend it.
