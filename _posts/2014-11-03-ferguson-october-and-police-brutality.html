<p>For SFL's blogging series, I had the wonderful opportunity of interviewing Chelsea McCoy and her friend Greg Fister over their experience with civil disobedience in St. Louis. Three weeks ago, they helped take part in the beginning of Ferguson October, a month dedicated to the protest of police brutality and subjugation of the black community. From overuse of force by police, being denied water and food for over 12 hours, and being detained for 16 hours, here's their experience as told by themselves.
