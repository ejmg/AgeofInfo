<address>Sorry for the lack of material lately, I've been extremely busy these past two weeks, and will be for the next two as well. Until then, please enjoy my first real attempt at using Gimp image manipulation software. This quote is a hint to my next post, so please keep checking up as I'll get back to writing soon. Thank you for visiting!</address>
