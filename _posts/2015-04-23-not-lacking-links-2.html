<p>Last week's miscellanea:</p>
<h4><a title="Is This Justice? Charging an Eighth Grader with a Felony for “Hacking”" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/justice-charging-eight-grader-felony-hacking" target="_blank">8th Grader being charged with felony for 'hacking'</a></h4>
<p>Within the tech community most people know about the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, a federal law that is used to heavily prosecute individuals for using computers in ways that 'were not intended.' What many people still do not know, however, is that several states have their own statutes of the same nature. Domanik Green's family found that out last week when he was charged with a felony for changing the background of his teacher's computer. Not only was it revealed that Domanik did nothing to the computer, but school officials also admitted cyber security was a huge issue at his school because teachers often logged into their computers in front of students. Not only is the law disproportional to the crime, but it risks ruining a young child's life before he has even had the chance to live it. America is in dire need of nullifying its old cyber security laws, less they ruin more innocent lives.</p>
<h4><a title="Assange: How 'The Guardian' Milked Edward Snowden's Story" href="http://www.newsweek.com/assange-how-guardian-milked-edward-snowdens-story-323480?piano_d=1" target="_blank">Guardian skews the Edward Snowden leaks in new book</a></h4>
<p>For the UK's self claimed leading news source, it is rather disparaging Julian Assange is accusing the paper of plagiarism and amateur confidentiality protocols. Nonetheless, his scathing review of <em>The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man</em> shows how mainstream media is still not afraid to make a buck at the cost of journalist integrity.</p>
<h4><a href="http://vcxc.org/documents/openletter.pdf" target="_blank">April 30th, Internet Independence Day</a></h4>
<p>Marc Cuban and a bunch of other internet greybeards are petitioning congress to enact laws that reverse/prevent the the title II ruling by the FCC over the internet, otherwise known as 'Net Neutrality.' The group believes the current 'hands off' approach to regulating the Internet is what has allowed the service to become the greatest engine of economic growth and prosperity since the Industrial revolution. On top of their attempts of overturning the ruling, they also propose that April 30th be declared Internet Independence Day, a holiday to celebrate the free nature of the Internet.</p>
<h4><a title="Ex-Blackwater Guards Given Long Terms for Killing Iraqis" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/us/ex-blackwater-guards-sentenced-to-prison-in-2007-killings-of-iraqi-civilians.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Former Blackwater employees convicted for murder in Iraq massacre</a></h4>
<p>Almost 9 years ago, a group of Blackwater mercenaries participated in the Nisour Square shooting, a moment in America's occupation that later became an icon of the brutalities inflicted upon the Iraqi population. Blackwater was a major military contractor for the United States, but after the Nisour incident, and many others, Blackwater eventually hit major financial setbacks. While it has taken 9 years for the victim's relatives to see justice served in American courts, the suspected murderers have received an endless wave of support.</p>
<h4><a href="https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/04/how-12-highly-successful-people-start-their-days/?utm_content=buffer28373&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">How 12 very successful business leaders start their days</a></h4>
<p>Interesting article from the World Economic Forum. While there is no single morning routine that works for everyone, what matters is having a routine that creates a stable and organized start to your day. Seems I have a lot to work on, haha.</p>
<h4><a title="Media Lab Director Joi Ito Wants MIT to Lead the Bitcoin Ecosystem" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/19982/media-lab-director-joi-ito-wants-mit-lead-bitcoin-ecosystem/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+BitcoinMagazine+%28Bitcoin+Magazine%29" target="_blank">MIT to start creating/hosting structural framework for Bitcoin</a></h4>
<p>For those who do not know, MIT's 'Media Lab' is a cutting edge research center that aims to create a free environment for radical innovation. Adding to the list of crazy ideas that have come from the Media Lab, a current proposal suggests creating a 'foundation' of sorts for the Bitcoin community to start establishing best practices and a framework for coordination. Bitcoin currently remains a highly decentralized currency in both good ways and bad, and MIT wants to eliminate the bad type of decentralization by fostering voluntary market collaboration. Almost reminds me of Cowen and Tabarrok's <a title="The End of Asymmetric Information" href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2015/04/06/alex-tabarrok-tyler-cowen/end-asymmetric-information" target="_blank">recent article on asymmetric information</a>.</p>
<h4><a title="United Airlines Stops Researcher Who Tweeted about Airplane Network Security from Boarding Flight to Security Conferences" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/united-airlines-stops-researcher-who-tweeted-about-airplane-network-security" target="_blank">Cyber security specialist questioned/searched by the Feds for revealing airline security flaws</a></h4>
<p>Another prime example of how industry leaders and the government are encouraging white hat hackers/tech specialists from helping to better secure our technology and software (often for free).</p>
<h4><a title="Licensed Dentist Attacked for Charging Too Little " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1z3KplC-IE" target="_blank">Licensed Orthodontists forced by state to stop providing cheap/free dental care to the poor</a></h4>
<p>Prime example of how forced government standards and licensing are often both non-essential and counter intuitive. I am happy to see the Institute for Justice fighting for the right to offer free and/or charitably discounted services to the less wealthy.</p>
<p>Here is the video from the link above.</p>
