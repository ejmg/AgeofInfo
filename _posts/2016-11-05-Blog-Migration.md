## the joys of web programming

I've had my new blog for just a few days and managed to migrate my old one to it, though the process was far from painless or straightforward. Being new to web development + Jekyll as a platform = plenty of confusion on my part. That said, I got all of my old blog posts moved over as well as most of the images. 

Each old post with an image has weird residual html tags that do not seem to play nicely with Jekyll's site generator and header levels also are off here and there. I will clean these up when I have the spare time, but I'm just happy to be done with the majority of the migration.

I'll be sure to post some more updates as they come along and I plan on making some sort of guide/post with the little lessons I learned along the way.  -- ejmg
