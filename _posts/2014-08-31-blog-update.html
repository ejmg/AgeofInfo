<p>The reason I've been posting random musings recently is threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was preparing for college/am now at college, which has stymied temporarily the amount of time I have been able to put into this.</li>
<li>I've recently been accepted on to the Students for Liberty blogging team, and</li>
<li>I've also been accepted on to the college newspaper, both of which are taking my focus.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are why I haven't posted anything substantial. Posts will be coming soon as theÂ posts I've submitted go up on the SFL website in September(which I'll post simultaneously here), but till then I will be lacking some material.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>-Elias</p>
