<p>With everything I will be doing this summer, I think a travelogue will be a fun way of reflecting on what I learn and see.</p>

<p class="result__title">I am currently at <a class="result__a" href="http://www.atlanta-airport.com/">Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport</a> on layover, waiting for a plane to take me to South Carolina to participate in the Foundation For Economic Education's seminar '<a href="https://fee.org/seminars/detail/communicating-capitalism" target="_blank">Communicating Capitalism</a>.' I got a travel scholarship in addition to the seminar itself, which FEE always provides gratis. If you have the tiniest interest in free market economics, and some free time next summer, I highly suggest you apply. I have already participated in two seminars prior to this year and the experience was both memorable and extremely educational.</p>
<p class="result__title">My current reading list is three fold right now: Douglass North's <em>Structures and Change in Economic History</em>, <em>Overfishing: What Everybody Needs to Know</em> by Ray Hilborn, and this:</p>

<p><em>A Student's Guide to Economics </em>may seem like a very lay introduction to the field of economics, but I have already gone through the first two sections and have discovered Paul Heyne is a fantastic teacher. Heyne's coverage provides a great overview on the basics of neoclassical thought, something I think everybody in economics probably needs to go over every once in a while.</p>
<p>My plane is about to board, so I will sign off for now.</p>
