<p>I am almost done with my second semester of college, and so far it has been an interesting experience. A lot of things are changing, especially the responsibilities that entail being a young adult and (hopeful) academic. This blog so far has served as a minor outlet for the pieces of writing I do here and there, and I have decided that role is going to change. I have begun to pursue some personal interests of mine within computer science and especially economics, and I feel the best way to help articulate and develop those ideas is through writing. Time will tell, but I have a lot of hope for what this blog can achieve.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
