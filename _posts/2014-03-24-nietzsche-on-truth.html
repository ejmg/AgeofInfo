<blockquote>Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which have been subjected to poetic and rhetorical intensification, translation, and decoration, and which, after they have been in use for a long time, strike a people as firmly established, canonical and binding; truths are illusions of which we have forgotten that they are illusions, metaphors which have been worn by frequent use and have lost all sensuous vigour</p></blockquote>
<p>--Friedrich Nietzsche from his work, "<b>On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense"</b></p>
<p><a title="Cornel West" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West" target="_blank">Cornel West</a>, a philosopher and activist, talks about how philosophy is the pursuit of 'Big T Truth' through the discovery of 'little t truth' in the documentary <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="The Examined Life" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vc-alL3nqU" target="_blank">The Examined</a></span><a title="The Examined Life" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vc-alL3nqU" target="_blank"> Life</a> by Astra Taylor. What he specifically touches on is the point that we will never truly be able to capture 'Big T Truth', which I believe to all of us is what we would consider to be <a title="Universality" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_(philosophy)" target="_blank">"Universal Truths" or <strong>The Truth</strong>(Reality as it is).</a> For people like West, we can only get closer and closer with more nuanced discoveries, 'little t truth', that prove previous theories wrong, etc; however, we'll never actually be able to achieve <em>The Truth. </em>We see this all around us, for in science, math, and in every field: facts are updated, theories are changed, and our understanding advances(but we never finish).</p>
<p>Nietzsche himself, within this quote, talks about the <a title="On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Truth_and_Lies_in_a_Nonmoral_Sense" target="_blank">barriers between our language and what is actual reality.</a> We construct our reality via language, our method of classifying and ordering the physical world around us. For many philosophers and linguists, the argument is that <a title="Relativism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism" target="_blank">we can never truly know what the Truth/Reality/Fact is 100% because of the 'Human Condition.'</a> Language, concepts of understanding, and the basis that humans are not perfect beings, all of this feeds into this theory, which is most commonly known as Relativism. This is a general idea that is a big issue of contention between the Analytic and Continental Schools of philosophy.</p>
<h4>These are the questions then:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Will our discoveries of 'little t truth' ever yield to the unveiling "Big T Truth?"</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Are we as humans capable of creating a method of understanding Reality for what it really is?</li>
</ul>
<p>Material to think about for the day.</p>
