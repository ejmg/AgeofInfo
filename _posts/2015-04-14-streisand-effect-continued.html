<p>I recently wrote about the <a title="Homophobic Pizzerias and the Streisand Effect" href="http://lackingmaterial.com/2015/04/04/homophobic-pizzerias-and-the-streisand-effect/" target="_blank">Streisand Effect and the Indiana Pizza parlor</a> that refuses to cater gay marriages. While not connected to the situation in Indiana, I thought I would mention this funny news story.</p>
<p>Turns out that in Obama's recent (and poorly worded) executive order over hacking, he banned the ability of people to donate to Edward Snowden. Rather than discourage donations by playing up the supposed problem of cyber security, Obama's action actually led to<a title="'Obama Effect' Results in 200 Bitcoin Donations to Edward Snowden" href="http://cointelegraph.com/news/113865/obama-effect-results-in-200-bitcoin-donations-to-edward-snowden" target="_blank"> a surge in donations to Edward Snowden through the use of Bitcoin</a>. So much for that, haha.</p>
